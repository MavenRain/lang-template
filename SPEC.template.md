# {{LANG}} specification (draft)

Status: draft before milestone M0. `{{LANG}}` is a working name.

Fill each section. The quoted line under each heading says what to write
there. Delete the quoted line when the section is complete.

## 1. Purpose

> Write here: what one program describes, what the compiler checks, and what
> it writes. Name the host and the target. Say that the core types and core
> operations are only those of `design/DESIGN.md`.

{{LANG}} is a language for <the domain>. Its type formers are F1 to F15 of
`formers/FORMERS.md`. Its core data types and core operations are only the
types and operations of `design/DESIGN.md` (the design).

## 2. Programs

> Write here: the form of a program and the refusal list. Copy the host
> forms from `formers/{{HOST}}.md`. Add each fixed first definition that the
> domain needs (for example a size parameter).

A program is a sequence of definitions:

```
def NAME : TYPE := TERM
```

The compiler refuses these host forms in a program: <the list from
`formers/{{HOST}}.md`>. It also refuses a definition that uses a core name or
a prelude name. Thus a program cannot add a data type, an unproved fact or
general recursion. Recursion comes only from `fold` and `unfold` (F6, F7).
The compiler writes the target; a program cannot.

## 3. Type formers

> Write here: only the deviations from the formers. Do not copy the forms.
> Give each former whose status in `formers/{{HOST}}.md` is not DONE, and the
> open item (section 9) that records it.

The type formers are F1 to F15 of `formers/FORMERS.md`. This language uses
the {{HOST}} column of the realization matrix. `formers/{{HOST}}.md` gives
the host form of each former.

| ID | Status on {{HOST}} | Effect on this language | Open item |
|---|---|---|---|
| | | | |

## 4. Structures

> Write here: the carriers of Monad (F5), fold and unfold (F6, F7) and
> filter (F8) that the design uses. Name each carrier that the host does not
> give.

- **Monad**: `pure`, `map`, `bind` on <carriers>.
- **Algebra**: `fold` on <carriers>. `unfold` on <carriers>, or the reason
  that there is no `unfold`.
- **Filterable**: `filter` on <carriers>.

## 5. Core types

> Write here (DOMAIN SLOT): only the types of `design/DESIGN.md`. Give each
> type its meaning in the design and its definition in host forms. Mark each
> definition that a probe fact forces with "probe-forced".

| Type | Meaning (design section) | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## 6. Core operations

> Write here (DOMAIN SLOT): only the operations of `design/DESIGN.md`. Give
> each operation its type and its meaning in the design.

| Operation | Type | Meaning (design section) |
|---|---|---|
| | | |

## 7. Target and instance encoding

> Write here: what the compiler writes. For a JSON target, give the instance
> rule and the encoding table. For a contract target, give the storage, the
> entries and the guards. Say how each proof erases.

An instance is a top-level definition whose type is a data type (F14).

| Type | Encoding |
|---|---|
| | |

## 8. Host and target

> Write here: the host, its pinned commit (`PIN`), the facts from
> `probe/CAPABILITY.md` that set the design, and the check that the compiler
> runs on its output (for example the axiom report).

## 9. Open items

> Write here: one item for each open question. Number the items O1, O2 and
> so on. Mark each decision as "RULED YYYY-MM-DD (USER): <the ruling>". Mark
> each fact that a probe found as "Probe-forced".

- O1. <question>.

## 10. Milestones

> Write here: the content of each milestone, and a dated status line under
> the current milestone.

| Milestone | Content |
|---|---|
| M0 | Host probe (`probe/CAPABILITY.md`); the core types construct and check; refusal list; examples and tests |
| M1 | Core operations |
| M2 | Queries and reads, or the contract |
| M3 | Hardening: speed, limits, a checked certificate for the output |
