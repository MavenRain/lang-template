# Domain interface

Replace the sample domain in `domain.lang` with the design of your
language. `gen/embed.c` embeds this file in `build/langc` at build time.
Its definitions have DOMAIN origin. Program files cannot redefine them.

`domain.lang` uses the program syntax, and it can also declare families:

```
family Color := red | green | blue
family Item := makeItem (itemColor : Color) (itemPrice : Nat) (itemCount : Nat)
family Lot (size : Nat) := makeLot (lotPrice : Nat)
def lineTotal : (item : Item) -> Nat :=
  fun (item : Item) => natMul (itemPrice item) (itemCount item)
```

- Only `domain.lang` can declare a family (rule R1). A program file that
  declares one is refused.
- Each family, constructor, field and definition name in `domain.lang`
  becomes a core name (rule R4). A program cannot reuse it.
- Constructor fields must have distinct names and cannot reuse their
  constructor's name. Collisions are refused with `REFUSE_NAME`.
- A field name is also its projection: `itemPrice item`.
- `fold` takes one case for each constructor, in declaration order.
- A family can have parameters, which give an indexed family (F15):
  `Lot 3`.
- A family lives in the largest universe of its fields. For example,
  `family U := makeU (decode : Type 0)` has type `Type 1`.
- Domain definitions are not instances. They do not appear in the JSON
  output of `langc build` or in the `document` of the JS module. A domain
  definition that `langc eval` runs as an entry is in the `entries` of the
  JS module.

The JSON form of a family value comes from its declaration: a string for
a family whose constructors have no fields, an object of fields for a
family with one constructor, and an object with a `tag` field for any
other family. The checker refuses `tag` as a field name in a family with
two or more constructors (`DOMAIN_FAMILY`), because it would overwrite
the JSON constructor tag. In the JS module, a family value is a frozen
`{kind: 'ctor', ctor, params, fields}`, and `encode` gives the JSON form.

After a change, update `examples/`, `test/eval/expect.txt` and the
goldens in `test/json/`, then run `make check`. The gate also checks the
JS module of each example against its JSON golden.
